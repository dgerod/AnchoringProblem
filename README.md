# Anchoring Problem

Working progress on the **Study of the Anchoring Problem in Generalist Robots**.

_Anchoring_ is the problem of connecting, inside an artificial system, symbols and sensor data that refer to the same physical objects in the external world. This problem needs to be solved in any robotic system that incorporates a symbolic component. More information in [[Coradeschi, 2003](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~kuipers/readings/Coradeschi-ras-03.pdf)], [Hertzberg](osnabrueck.de/hertzberg/SAI_3-ObjAnc.pdf)][[McCrae, 2008](https://cinacs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=158)].
